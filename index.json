With this increasing demand and popularity, it is becoming equally difficult and challenging to implement and consume GAN models. A qualitative user survey conducted across 47 practitioners show that expert level skill is required to use GAN model for a given task, despite the presence of various open source libraries. In this research, we propose a novel system called AuthorGAN, aiming to achieve true democratization of GAN authoring. A highly modularized library agnostic repre- sentation of GAN model is defined to enable interoperability of GAN architecture across different libraries such as Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. An intuitive drag-and-drop based visual designer is built using node-red platform to enable custom architecture designing without the need for writing any code. Five different GAN models are implemented as a part of this framework and the performance of the different GAN models are shown using the benchmark MNIST dataset.\n","date":1573052598,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573052598,"objectID":"39fdbd98dfb8186fdcf2b8adcf1f4d03","permalink":"http://sinha-raunak.github.io/project/authogan/","publishdate":"2019-11-06T20:33:18+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/authogan/","section":"project","summary":"Toolkit for code-less authoring of GANs.
